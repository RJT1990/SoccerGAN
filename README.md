Generating soccer players using a WGAN-GP model. See the enclosed repository for the Jupyter Notebook used to construct these results. The accompanying blog post can be viewed at http://www.rosstaylor.xyz/soccergan/. 

Results were run using a p2.xlarge instance on AWS; training took around 15 hours. The dataset can be obtained from https://www.fmscout.com/a-df11-facepacks-2018.html.
